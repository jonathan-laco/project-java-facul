Here is a rewritten version of your README:

---

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Follow this guide to get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders by default:

- `src`: Contains source files
- `lib`: Contains dependencies

Compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. For more details, visit [Manage Dependencies](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
